It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/\\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,\\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is \\nall I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years\\nof production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you\\nhave on this funky looking car, please e-mail.\\n\\nThanks,\\n- IL\\n   ---- brought to you by your neighborhood Lerxst ----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

(i realize\\nthis is a real subjective question, but i\\'ve only played around with the\\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\\n\\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\\n\\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i\\'ll post a\\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\\ncorner... :( )\\n--\\nTom Willis  \\\\  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \\\\    Purdue Electrical Engineering\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.\"  - F.
